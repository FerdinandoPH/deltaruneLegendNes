# Deltarune - The Legend (Famicom)

### By Fernando Pérez Holguín

---

This project consists on making a faithful recreation of Deltarune's intro for the real Famicom/NES.

It uses the VRC6 mapper for better music and for the scanline IRQ.

I want to thank the cc65 team for making the compiler, shiru and nesdoug for making the libraries, the famistudio team for the sound engine, hEYDON for the music rendition, and, of course, Toby Fox for obvious reasons.
