# Deltarune - The Legend (Famicom)

### By Fernando Pérez Holguín

---

This project consists on making a faithful recreation of Deltarune's intro for the real Famicom/NES.

It uses the VRC6 mapper for better music and for the scanline IRQ.

I'm in a hurry to publish this, since its deadline is june 3rd (the day before Deltarune's release), but I'll flesh out this README and clean the code and add comments asap.

I want to thank the cc65 team for making the compiler, shiru and nesdoug for making the libraries, the famistudio team for the sound engine, xWhyohwhyx for the music rendition, and, of course, Toby Fox for obvious reasons.
